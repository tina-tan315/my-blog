                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>Last Friday I worked on the Type here brief and managed to have a final idea of the poster. I have also created my lo-fi wireframes for the application.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will start to create a user testing plan to conduct for my lo-fi wireframe, I will also start to make the slides for the presentation and maybe also work on the design strategy document.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>No blockers.</p>

                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>Yesterday I started to plan out the user testing questions and the area I need to test in.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will be conducting the user tests today, and will be making the presentation slides.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>A blocker would be that still a little lost in making the slide and the design strategy document.</p>

                        <p>I conducted user testing on the lo-fi wireframes and recorded the transcript down.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will be making the presentation slides and create a slide which matches with my brand for future use of this project.</p>

                        <p>I created moodboard for visual directions and finished making the slides for the presentation and practiced it.</p>

                        <p>I will be presenting today. Before and after the presentation, I will be working on the design strategy document.</p>

                        <h3>Week 4 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>This week, I conducted usability testing for my lo-fi wireframes and gathered clear, actionable feedback. I also created a moodboard, started developing brand identity elements, and worked on the design strategy document. Completing the pitch presentation and receiving feedback gave me clarity and direction for moving forward. I felt productive and confident, especially with the validation I received from both user testing and lecturer input.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>I occasionally felt overwhelmed balancing multiple deliverablesâ€”slides, strategy document, and prototype updates. While I did manage to complete the tasks, there was some uncertainty about what to prioritise next. At times, I lacked confidence in whether I was moving in the right direction.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>I&apos;ve learned that breaking large tasks into smaller, prioritised steps can help reduce stress and improve focus. I also realised that consistent check-ins (with peers and lecturers) helped me stay aligned and confident in my direction.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Begin transitioning lo-fi wireframes into hi-fi prototypes</li>
                            <li>Start creating brand identity and stylescape</li>
                            <li>Keep brand direction consistent across all design outputs</li>
                            <li>Test hi-fi prototypes for further iteration</li>
                        </ul></p>
