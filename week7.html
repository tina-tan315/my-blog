                        <h3>Week 7 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>This week, I conducted hi-fi usability testing with participants and gathered feedback on both the UI and the functionality of the prototype. The feedback helped me find areas that were working well , like the clear dashboard layout and helpful storage tips. Also confirmed that the overall user flow was intuitive. I also summarised the feedback, and made changes to my hi-fi according to the feedback.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>Some UI elements were still a bit hard to read. I realised that font contrast, hierarchy, and accessibility needed to be addressed more thoroughly.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>Iâ€™ve learned that testing is very important and is very insightful as myself have the idea of what I am doing and needing others to see the weakness of the app. I also realised the importance of accessibility, especially with the choices of fonts to use.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Finalise all remaining prototype interactions and UI refinements</li>
                            <li>Start preparing documentation and presentation materials for submission</li>
                        </ul></p>
