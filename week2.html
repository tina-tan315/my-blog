                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>Blocker was that I needed to make the slides for WIP to be handed in by EoD but there were still things that I needed to work on my FigJam board for adding it in to the slides.</p>

                        <h3>Week 2 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>I conducted user interviews and extracted useful insights that helped identify core pain points around food storage, expiry confusion, and waste. I felt engaged during analysis and was able to cluster key themes quickly. Creating the empathy map and persona clarified the user perspective. I stayed on track with my Sprint goal of developing user understanding and generating insights.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>Some interviews didn&apos;t go as in-depth as I hoped. I sometimes struggled to ask follow-up questions that would encourage deeper reflections. The interviews were all quite short which may be the reason why it didn&apos;t led into a deeper conversation.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>I&apos;ve learned that refining my interview techniques, such as using more open-ended or probing follow-up questions. I think that can help draw out deeper responses. I also need to allocate more time for analysis and insight mapping in future sprints.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Start ideating solution concepts based on key opportunity areas</li>
                            <li>Create a future state user journey and create user flow</li>
                            <li>Start creating paper prototype</li>
                            <li>Improve time planning for synthesis and creative work</li>
                        </ul></p>
