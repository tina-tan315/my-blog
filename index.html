                        <p>Technical bootcamp to create a cupcake site to refresh the knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will start to research my area of inquiry for my brief.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>First wasn&apos;t able to sync files to Github with VS Code but found out the reason why - had to publish it...</p>

                        <p>Finished the cupcake site within the timeframe, accomplished 4 htmls alongside with css stylesheet. I have researched and decided to continue with the theme of food security and the topic will be food literacy.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>Conduct secondary research of the topic and come up with the problem statement.</p>

                        <p>Researching for food literacy in NZ was difficult, couldn&apos;t find up-to-dated information. Articles were all quite old.</p>

                        <h3>Week 1 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>During the design process, I was able to clearly identify the direction of my project on food literacy and storage. I felt confident and focused during ideation process, which led into creating my problem statement. Gathering secondary research sources and building an assumption map helped me solidify my own understanding of the problem. I successfully completed the sprints goals I have set for week 1  of framing the problem and starting the research early.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>There were som parts I was uncertain which slowed the process. I initially had quite a broader concept, and I felt slightly overwhelmed trying to narrow it down. Feedback from my lecturer highlighted that my initial idea was already “solved,” which made me rethink and rework the direction. This caused a bit of a delay in moving forward.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>I need to spend less time on broad ideas and more time validating and refining my focus earlier. Time management during ideation could also be improved to avoid feeling stuck.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Conducting user interviews based on the updated research questions</li>
                            <li>Analysis insights from interviews</li>
                            <li>Create a user journey map based on findings</li>
                            <li>Define a solution</li>
                        </ul></p>
