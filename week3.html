                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>Last Friday I worked on defining my solutions and worked a little bit on the type here brief.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will finalise my solution idea and maybe start sketching out paper prototypes.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>Finalising idea might be difficult as there is a lot of ideas that I wanted to do, but I&apos;ll need to choose a main idea to focus on.</p>

                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>I have created my one sentence pitch for the project and also created future state user journey and user flow.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will be making a site map of the application and research about proof of concept.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>Creating site map might be a blocker as previously I have only made a site map for websites and am quite unsure of how to create one for a application.</p>

                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>I finished making the site map and did some research on proof of concept.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will be drawing out the paper prototype, maybe start creating moodboards for the brand.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>A blocker might be that I&apos;m a little lost in the process of what to do next, but I think I&apos;ll talk with the lecturer to get a better understanding of what to do next.</p>

                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>I created paper prototype and thought about how to turn that into a lo-fi wireframe.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will start making the mood board for the brand and think about the brand identity, assets, etc.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>No blockers today, talking with the lecturer yesterday gave me a clear direction and I&apos;ll just need to keep moving on with the project.</p>

                        <h4>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h4>
                        <p>Yesterday, I worked on starting to create my lo-fi wireframes and started to make the frames.</p>
                        <h4>What will I do today?</h4>
                        <p>I will be working on the Type here brief and start to make a few designs to iterate further and begin to finalise my final poster idea. I have also thought about the interactive part of the Type here brief.</p>
                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>I think there isn&apos;t much blocker.</p>

                        <h3>Week 3 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>I began ideating potential solutions and narrowed down my focus to food storage and expiry tracking. I created a one-sentence pitch and started mapping out user flows and future journey scenarios also created a site map. This helped me visualise the core functionality of the platform. I felt more confident in the project direction and successfully met my Sprint goal of moving from insights to early concepts. I have also started to create my lo-fi prototypes which was within my plans.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>I felt a bit stuck choosing between multiple solution ideas. I spent some time on if I wanted to add features like recipe generation, which slowed down decision-making. Some design elements also started to feel too broad again.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>I learned the value of focusing on a single, strong idea instead of trying to combine too many features which may make the project too complex and not focusing on the main pain point. Simplicity and clarity are more impactful at this stage. I also need to trust my user insights more when prioritising features.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Start to create brand identity</li>
                            <li>Start thinking about the Proof of Concept interaction</li>
                            <li>Keep the solution tightly aligned with user pain points and scope</li>
                            <li>Conduct user testing for lo-fi and then start to create hi-fi prototype</li>
                        </ul></p>
