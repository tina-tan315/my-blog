                        <h4>Are there any blockers?</h4>
                        <p>A blocker might be that it is hard to decide on the logo and too many ideas coming through, just very hard to decide which one I should be using for the brand.</p>

                        <h3>Week 5 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>This week, I successfully transitioned from lo-fi prototypes to developing the brand identity for my app. I created a stylescape, finalised the colour palette, and designed brand illustrations that matched the youthful, quirky, and approachable tone of voice. I also made strong progress on the design system, working toward high-fidelity prototypes. These developments kept me aligned with building a visually appealing brand direction alongside refining the app&apos;s structure.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>I sometimes got caught up refining small visual details, which slowed down my overall progress, and I learnt that not to think too much of one thing and just let it flow.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>I learned that while attention to visual details is important, it&apos;s important to set clear time limits for each task to avoid perfectionism which is slowing my speed down. Prioritising core functionality first, then polishing later, would be a more efficient workflow.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Focus on completing hi-fi prototypes with key user flows fully functional</li>
                            <li>Prepare for hi-fi usability testing by drafting a testing plan</li>
                            <li>Keep visual refinement secondary to functionality and flow clarity</li>
                            <li>Continue maintaining brand consistency across the app UI</li>
                        </ul></p>
