                        <h3>Week 6 Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <h4>What went well?</h4>
                        <p>This week, I made progress on making the hi-fi prototype, ensuring that the key user flows are visually consistent and smoothly functioned. I refined and expanded on the existing pages, such as notifications and widgets, and continued to align the UI with the youthful, quirky brand identity I developed earlier.</p>
                        <h4>What didn&apos;t go well?</h4>
                        <p>While refining the hi-fi prototype, I sometimes got caught up in the small design details like tweaking spacing, colours, and layouts  which slowed down my progress more than expected. Also I realised that some of the layout may not look that intuitive and needed to be refined further.</p>
                        <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                        <p>The use of my illustration could be improved as now it is just acting as a design element but instead I could use the different characters in different area, for example, one character as the welcoming character and others can act different positions.</p>
                        <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>Finalise and polish the hi-fi prototype based on the WIP feedback</li>
                            <li>Draft a clear usability testing plan and recruit participants</li>
                            <li>Focus on capturing user feedback on core flows rather than visual design details</li>
                        </ul></p>
